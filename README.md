# Certificate Generator Application

This project is a part of the Software Principles module and consists of two major components:

## 🔹 Part 1 – Group Design Report (RedGate Live Brief)
A collaborative design solution for a scalable Certificate Generator system. The report includes:
- Requirements gathering
- Wireframes & navigation map
- Use case & flow diagrams
- Pseudocode and trace tables
- UI prototypes
- System evaluation based on principles

The app is designed to automate and streamline certificate creation with features like:
- Dynamic input fields for recipient info and event details
- Customizable templates
- AI-aided design recommendations
- Compatibility with multiple OS platforms

## 🔹 Part 2 – Java-Based Implementation
An individual console-based Java application implementing core logic from the group design. Features:
- Follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Contains 3+ classes, with real-world attributes (e.g., name, eventType, date)
- Demonstrates class interaction via a functional `main()` method
- Includes error handling and basic input simulation
